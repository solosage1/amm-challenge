## Simulation Forensics Insights

### Edge Timing Patterns
- Early game (steps 0-3000): 36.9% of total edge
- Mid game (steps 3000-7000): 45.8% of total edge
- Late game (steps 7000+): 17.3% of total edge
- Peak edge at step: 9833

### Volatility Regime Performance
- High-vol periods: 0.0 avg edge
- Low-vol periods: 0.0 avg edge

### Fee Timing Analysis
- Timing correctness score: 4.70
- GOOD: High fees align with high mispricing

### Arbitrage Detection
- Price corrections: 27.0% of steps
- Arb corrects price 27.0% of steps - unreliable arb signal

### Top vs Bottom Strategy Comparison

### Recommended Actions
- Consider lower initial fees to capture more early retail volume
- Arb occurs infrequently; need fallback fair price method for no-arb steps
