ITERATION 6 TIMEOUT ANALYSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Problem:
  Codex spent 25 minutes on sophisticated parameter optimization
  - 131 reasoning steps captured
  - 6 strategic pivots
  - Multiple rounds of validation (80 → 200 → 400 sims)
  - Hierarchical parameter decomposition
  - Timed out before finalizing contract

Intelligence Rating: 9/10 (exceptional adaptive reasoning)

Discovered Configuration:
  FLOW_SIZE_COEF = 6800 (baseline: 5600, +21.4%)
  TOX_COEF       = 180  (baseline: 200, -10%)
  TOX_QUAD_COEF  = 19000 (baseline: 20000, -5%)
  Predicted improvement: +0.15 bps

Status: Lost due to timeout (no final contract produced)


NEXT ITERATION EXPECTATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Iteration 8 will be selected next by UCB1 mechanism.

Likely candidates:
  - toxicity_and_activity (retry with 45-min timeout)
  - regime_estimators (failed in iter 1, may be retried)
  - Other mechanisms with low try counts

With 45-minute timeout:
  ✓ Codex has 1.8x more time to complete reasoning
  ✓ Should be able to finish sophisticated optimization processes
  ✓ Can complete validation escalation without rushing


FILES MODIFIED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

scripts/simplified_loop_ctl.sh
  - Added LLM_TIMEOUT_MINUTES environment variable (default: 45.0)
  - Added to environment overrides documentation
  - Added --llm-timeout-minutes parameter to loop command


MONITORING COMMANDS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

# Check status
scripts/simplified_loop_ctl.sh status

# Watch logs
scripts/simplified_loop_ctl.sh logs

# Monitor iterations
tail -f .ralph-amm/phase7/state/iteration_log.jsonl

# Check if toxicity_and_activity gets retried
grep "toxicity_and_activity" .ralph-amm/phase7/state/iteration_log.jsonl


KEY INSIGHTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Iteration 6 wasn't a reasoning failure - it was a time allocation failure

   Codex demonstrated exceptional intelligence (9/10) but ran out of time
   before finalizing the optimized contract.

2. The 45-minute timeout should accommodate Codex's sophisticated reasoning

   Codex's multi-stage validation approach (screening → validation →
   confirmation) requires time for multiple simulation runs.

3. If toxicity_and_activity is selected again, expect strong results

   Codex has already proven it knows how to:
   - Learn from failure (iteration 5)
   - Verify framework assumptions
   - Decompose complex parameter spaces
   - Find improvements through structured search

4. The reasoning quality (9/10) is more important than the timeout failure

   The fact that Codex can think at this level is the real achievement.
   The timeout increase simply gives it the resources to complete its work.


RECOMMENDATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ Continue running the loop with 45-minute timeout
✓ Monitor for toxicity_and_activity retry (likely iteration 8 or later)
✓ Watch for completion of sophisticated reasoning processes
✓ If another timeout occurs at 45 minutes, consider increasing to 60 minutes

The loop is now properly configured to support Codex's high-quality reasoning.
